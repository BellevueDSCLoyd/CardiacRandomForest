# Cardiac Disease Classification Using a Random Forest Model

<img src="images/randomforest.jpg" width ="500">

## Description

This model was trained using a random forest model to predict cardiac disease. 

## Data

The Kaggle [data](https://www.kaggle.com/sid321axn/heart-statlog-cleveland-hungary-final) provided by [Manu Siddhartha](https://www.kaggle.com/sid321axn).

## EDA 

A pandas-profiling [report](https://sdloyd.github.io/CardiacRandomForest/pandasprofile/rfcardio-pandas-profile-report.html) is available.

## Code

The [code](https://github.com/SDLoyd/CardiacRandomForest/blob/master/code/FinalProject.ipynb) was created in python using Jupyter notebook.
